NEO-WAVES
From www.TTHQ.com
For a long time, many of you have asked me to release material on NEoWave pattern
discoveries, such as NEoWave Diametrics, Neutral Triangles, Neutral Terminals and the like.
With the markets slowing down lately, and work on our major website upgrade nearing
completion, I've had a little time to hunt through our archives for information from past
seminars.
Attached is material used in my 1995 NEoWave Workshop held at the Ritz-Carlton in Aspen,
Colorado that covers many NEoWave pattern discoveries up to that time. I think you will find
this material very informative and instructive.
Sincerely,
Glenn Neely

Diametric Formations
I experienced my first Diametric formation in 1991. What started out looking like a
Contracting Triangle, stopped behaving like one when wave-e became larger than wave-d. If
wave-e had moved quickly enough and far enough, I could have concluded the pattern as a
Zigzag from the low in 1991. But, the problem is that wave-e did not move quickly enough
out of the congestion to indicate anything critical had concluded.
That is when I started to realize that a new wave phenomenon was unfolding. It was simply a
process of elimination.

Neutral Triangles (wave-c longest)
The is a new variation in this well known group. It is the missing “link” that explains many
heretofore indecipherable periods of pattern development. A Neutral Triangle is the logical
missing formation that delicately connects the Impulsive world to the Triangular world. If you
compare 1st, 3rd and 5th wave Extensions to Triangular patterns, there is a clear area of
behavior not covered by R.N. Elliott’s original group. That missing pattern is the Neutral
Triangle. Just like a 3rd wave Extension Impulse pattern, the middle wave (wave-c) is the
longest in a Neutral Triangle. Their characteristics are also extremely similar to 3rd Extension
Impulse patterns.

Extracting Triangles
This type of Triangle follows all the rules and variations of those previously listed. The unique
aspect of this Triangular sub-category is that the alternation that is normally present in a
Triangle (based on which wave is the longest) is reversed. This creates a VERY strange
looking formation that can be very difficult to anticipate (at least if your experience is primarily
in the 80’s bull market, which had a completely different character). The only early warning
behavior characteristic I have been able to find relates to wave-b. When the b-wave of what
looks like a Zigzag takes less time than waves-a or c, an Extracting Triangle is likely.

3rd Extension Terminals
This pattern takes on a strange and difficult to interpret structure that is usually discovered
only after its conclusion (or shortly before conclusion if the pattern is large enough). This is
what an Extracting Triangle looks like.
5th Failure Terminals
These patterns basically mimic 3rd Extension Impulse patterns, except waves-2 and 4
overlap and the internal structure of each move is corrective, not
Impulsive.

• Common BEHAVIOR mistakes associated with Impulsions
Expanding Triangles (spike at extremes)
Expanding Triangles have a strong tendency to ”spike” when reaching the highest or lowest
point of the termination of each wave. This creates an identifiable characteristic that can be
used to identify their existence in almost any market situation. observation. Detection of this
behavior (price action “spiking” near the extremes) can help you decide what kind of
environment the market is in even when an exact wave count is not obvious.

Neutral Triangles (even distribution of behavior)
Neutral Triangles are some of the calmest, most consistently behaving patterns under
NEoWave™ Theory. If the market’s behavior and style is not changing much, even if the
market is covering a lot of price and time territory, that is the environment of a Neutral
Triangle.

Extracting Triangles
The thrust out of an Extracting triangle is not as violent as that experienced by a Contracting
Triangle, but not as slow as that of an Expanding Triangle. Based on our previous
discussions, it should be obvious that the market environment this pattern creates is that of a
neutral bias.

5th Failure Terminals (Supplemental price)
All Terminals (and Triangles) experience what I call Supplemental Price and Time action.
That is when the market goes slightly beyond the best calculated price and
time zones, only to reverse and do what was originally expected. Unfortunately, it is right at
the end of this pattern that the average trader gives up, reverses his position, only to be
stopped out. Shortly thereafter, the large trend he was predicting ends up happening
WITHOUT him.
5th Failure Terminals (severe alternation)
This is among the strangest and most difficult to decipher patterns under NEoWave™
Theory. They are difficult to be sure of even AFTER they have completed.
The pattern is so warped by the extreme differences in size between waves 2 & 4 that it is
frequently only possible to identify them well after their conclusion.

Text: Each successive decline is smaller in price - higher LOWS
Each successive rally is larger in price. - higher HIGHS
This is the type of behaviour that characterizes an EXTRACTING TRIANGLE
The most important trait of this pattern appears to be that
wave-D is always larger than wave-C
and it is usually the most complicated wave in the pattern (from a visual standpoint).
